# WebSite_sell_figurine

> My first website project in PHP

## Objective

The goal was to sell figurines that I printed in 3D and then painted for them.
So I needed a showcase site that also allowed people to send me messages.
So I started creating this site, which allowed me to improve my HTML and CSS, as well as learn PHP.

### Starting

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/axelvag/WebSite_sell_figurine.git WebSite_sell_figurine

# Access
$ cd WebSite_sell_figurine

# Put it in a php host/manager like 000WebHost

# DADAM you have your website online
```
